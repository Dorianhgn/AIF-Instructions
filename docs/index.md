# AIF Instructions - ML Application Development Guide

Welcome to the AIF Instructions documentation! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process of building, containerizing, orchestrating, and deploying a machine learning application.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This guide covers the complete journey from training a neural network to deploying it in the cloud:

### Part 1: API & Backend
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize drawings from the "Quick, Draw!" dataset, then expose it through a FastAPI web service.

- **Building the Model**: Train a PyTorch CNN for image recognition
- **Exposing with FastAPI**: Create a REST API to serve predictions

### Part 2: Dockerisation
Package your application into Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments.

### Part 3: Orchestration
Learn how to orchestrate multiple containers and services efficiently.

### Part 4: Cloud Deploy
Deploy your application to the cloud for production use.

## 🚀 Getting Started
